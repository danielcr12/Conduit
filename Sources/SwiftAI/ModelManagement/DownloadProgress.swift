// MARK: - DownloadProgress

/// Progress information for a model download.
///
/// Tracks the progress of downloading model files from remote sources,
/// including byte counts, file progress, transfer speed, and estimated
/// time remaining.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let progress = DownloadProgress(
///     bytesDownloaded: 512_000_000,
///     totalBytes: 2_000_000_000,
///     currentFile: "model.safetensors",
///     filesCompleted: 2,
///     totalFiles: 5
/// )
///
/// print("Progress: \(progress.percentComplete)%")  // "Progress: 25%"
/// print("Fraction: \(progress.fractionCompleted)")  // "Fraction: 0.256"
/// ```
///
/// ## Computed Properties
///
/// - `fractionCompleted`: Progress as a decimal (0.0 to 1.0)
/// - `percentComplete`: Progress as an integer (0 to 100)
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This struct conforms to `Sendable` and can be safely passed across
/// actor boundaries for progress reporting.

/// 3. `.paused` - Temporarily suspended (if supported)
/// 4. `.completed(URL)` - Successfully finished
/// 5. `.failed(Error)` - Encountered an error
/// 6. `.cancelled` - User cancelled the download
///
/// ## State Transitions
///
/// ```
///     pending ──> downloading ──> completed(URL)
///                     │    │

///
/// ## Observable State
///
/// The task is marked with `@Observable`, making it work seamlessly with
/// SwiftUI and other observation frameworks:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct DownloadView: View {
///     @State var task: DownloadTask
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             ProgressView(value: task.progress.fractionCompleted)
///             Text("\(task.progress.percentComplete)%")
///
///             switch task.state {
///             case .downloading:
///                 Button("Cancel") { task.cancel() }
///             case .paused:
///                 Button("Resume") { task.resume() }
///             case .completed:
///                 Text("Download complete!")
///             default:
///                 EmptyView()
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Create task via `ModelManager.download(_:)` or provider method
/// 2. Task starts in `.pending` state
/// 3. Automatically transitions to `.downloading`
/// 4. Progress updates flow through `progress` property
/// 5. Ends in `.completed`, `.failed`, or `.cancelled` state
///
/// ## Concurrency
///
/// The task is `@unchecked Sendable` because it uses an `NSLock` for
/// thread-safe access to mutable state. This is necessary because
/// `@Observable` types with mutable state require synchronization.
///
/// ## Cancellation
///
/// ```swift
/// let task = provider.download(model)
///
/// // Cancel from any thread
/// task.cancel()
///
/// // Wait for cancellation to complete
/// do {
///     _ = try await task.result()
/// } catch {
///     // Handle cancellation error
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Pause/Resume
///
/// Not all providers support pause/resume. Check provider documentation:
///
/// ```swift
/// task.pause()
/// // ... later ...
/// task.resume()
/// ```
